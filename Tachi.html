                <p class="text-muted">The sword is the predecessor to the Katana; the Tachi is a Japanese sword that is more curved and longer than a katana. Having an average length of 75 cm. It was primarily made for Samurais on horseback where they needed more length and curvature to effectively charge on foot soldiers.

                    While all of these are types of the bladed weapons used by the noble Japanese warriors, each and every one has its unique characteristics and uses. It would be unfair to ignore all the different types of swords, just to popularize one over the others. A wider approach is needed to recognize the skill and genius of the Japanese Samurai and craftsman.
